Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.\\r\\r\\n</td>\n",

They have confronted sulfuric    boiling black sea bottoms and stayed,     held on under ten tons of polar ice,    established themselves in dense salts    and acids, survived eating metal ions.    They are more committed than oblivion,    more prolific than stars.  Far too ancient for scripture, each  one bears in its one cell one text—  the first whit of alpha, the first    jot of bearing, beneath the riling    sun the first nourishing of self.     Too lavish for saints, too trifling    for baptism, they have existed    throughout never gaining girth enough    to hold a firm hope of salvation.  Too meager in heart for compassion,  too lean for tears, less in substance  than sacrifice, not one has ever    carried a cross anywhere.  And not one of their trillions    has ever been given a tombstone.    I’ve never noticed a lessening    of light in the ceasing of any one    of them. They are more mutable    than mere breathing and vanishing,    more mysterious than resurrection,    too minimal for death.\\r\\r\\n</td>\n",
