# Poems Data Dictionary

## Context

This data set has been built from a variety of sources. The spine of it comes from Kaggle. It can be found at the following link: <https://www.kaggle.com/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems>

I have supplemented using web scrapes to find more information on the poets' sex, dates and country of origin.

I have created columns to capture structural elements of the poem: number of lines, number of stanzas.

Finally, I have extracted the tags applied to the poems with a column per tag.

This data set has been designed to be used for NLP classification projects.
